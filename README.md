# Overview

This is a beta stock market advisor. While there is a lot left to be done, it does have some basic functionality.

I have always been interested in the stock market and I don't want to have to pay for something to help me, so I wanted to make something that would do that for free.

# Development Environment

Using a combination of Rstudio and VSCode I was able to write the software, and using the FMPcloud stock api, I was able to gather relevant and recent data about the stocks I was interested in.

I wrote this program in R so I would be able to use graphing at a later date.
